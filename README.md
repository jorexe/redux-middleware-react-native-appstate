# Deprecated - No longer maintained

My focus has left the node / react ecosystem and this module is no
longer maintained. 

Thank you for your patience and using this module in the first place!

## Installation

    npm install --save redux-middleware-react-native-appstate

## Usage

```js
// Just import the middleware and add it to your store
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { middleware as appState } from 'redux-middleware-react-native-appstate';
const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(appState)(createStore);

// And in your reducers receive the value
import { TYPE as APP_STATE } from 'redux-middleware-react-native-appstate';

function appStateReducer(state = {}, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case APP_STATE:
            console.log('AppState:', action.payload);

        default:
            return state;
    }
}

```
